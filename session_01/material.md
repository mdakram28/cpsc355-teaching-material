- VIM

	Operating modes in vim editor:

	- **Command Mode:** By default, command mode is on as soon as the vim editor is started. This command mode helps users to copy, paste, delete, or move text. We should be pressing [Esc] key to go to command mode when we are in other modes.
	- **Insert mode:** Whenever we try to open vim editor, it will go to command mode by default. To write the contents in the file, we must go to insert mode. Press ‘I’ to go to insert mode. If we want to go back to command mode, press the [Esc] key.
